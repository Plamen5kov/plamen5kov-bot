This is a simple implementation of a chatbot:

I'm using:
* Watson Conversation: get started [here](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/conversation/). 
IBM are good enough to provide you with an easy getting started tutorial, and a [nodejs sdk](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/node-sdk) to use to integrate with your software.
* Facebook Messenger API: get started [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform). 
The people from facebook are also providing you with a webhook, [node sdk](https://github.com/Charca/bootbot) and documentation to guide you through the embedding process. 
* Google API(youtube): get started [here](https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/dashboard). There’s some documentation, but it’s difficult to follow through.

You won't be able to run my bot, because the credentials folder is git ignored :D
But feel free to look through the code.
